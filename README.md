## Food Truck Project

### Overview

This is a Java Program which has user create a Food Truck database, and allows user to perform the following:

* Review itemized Food Truck data, including Name, ID Number, Food Served, and Rating;

* Review the average Rating of the Food Trucks entered into the database;

* Review the highest-rated Food Truck in the database;

### How to Run

  1.  Compile and/or run FoodTruckProject in a compatible IDE or Java Runtime Environment of your choice.
  2.  Enter relative Food Truck data as prompted by the program.  User has the ability to enter data for up to five (5) Food Trucks.  Should user choose to enter data  for less than five Food Trucks, user may type 'quit' at the name prompt.  This will stop data entry and send user to the main menu.
  3.  Select one of four (4) options on the main menu:

    - Option Three allows user to see the highest-rated truck in the database, as entered by user.
    - Option Four allows user to quit the program.
  4. Have Fun!

### Lesson(s) Learned

* This project provided an opportunity to understand the the function of an Object, the necessary parts of an Object, and creation and utilization of an Object.
* This project presented an opportunity to better understand scope of variables and methods, and the necessary mechanisms to call them to/from other classes and methods.
* This project presented an opportunity to better understand how to compartmentalize functions into separate methods, to allow for better readability and logic flow, and to reduce redundancy.
